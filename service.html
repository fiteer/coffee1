                    <p>We know that finding the right recipe for weeknight dinners or holiday feasts can be tricky. Some recipes look great on paper, but the end result is disappointing. To help make picking the perfect recipe a little bit easier, we launched Recipe Badges. You’ll find these badges on our top recipes—as voted by our community or hand selected by our editors. These tried-and-true dishes are ones we return to over and over again and we know you’ll love them, too.</p>
